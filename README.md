# Dotfiles

5/13/2020

Yesterday I finally cut over to using [Doom
Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) instead of VSCode, and I have
created this repo to store the configuration files found in `~/.doom.d`

If you wish to use my editor configs, you'll definitely need to start with
getting Doom emacs set up as outlined in the documentation found at the link above.
